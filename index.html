      <H2>The wheelerbot</H2>
      <p>For the first period of school, we had to create a smart device that would help in daily life. We created the wheelerbot to help fight the war against egotistical cyclers.
        <p> I specifically helped in programming the mechanism of it going up and down after a button is pressed. I also designed the board with multiple symbols on it, kindly telling cyclers to bugger off.</p>
        <p>My bike was also used for the prototype. We applied the custom made board on it, and tested it outside too.</p>
      </p>
      <p>Under this text is a presentation of the wheelerbot. Sadly, it's in Dutch and also flipped on it's side. My excuses for the inconvience.</p>

      <p>For the second period of school, I worked with the Dutch FGC group Zero Fundamentals to create a website for them that allows players to register themselves for a tournament. This was my first time fully working alone on a big project such as this</p>
        <p>The website works as a place where players can sign up for upcoming tournaments. They can check which tournaments they're signed up for.</p>
      <p>Administrators can check which players are signed up, create new tournaments, and also delete players from tournaments.</p>
      <p>All in all, the project was a big success, and the website was recently used while running tournaments.</p>

      <p>For the third period of school, I worked together with a group to create BegrijpBaar, a website that helps people with an auditory defection to still enjoy a day out. Whether it be museums or amusement parks.</p>
      <p>I created the page made for administrators where they can add their own activity and use it to show it to give additional information about specific places within their activity.</p> 
      <p>There is also a live notification system that sends messages to said activity. This is then shown to every user on that page.</p>

      <h2>Puzzle 1943</h2>
      <a href="https://jahuanfortes.github.io/CLE_4-GROUP-PROJ/">Play Puzzle 1943 now</a>
      <img src="pics/puzzle1943.PNG" alt="Puzzle screenshot">
      <p>For the final period of my first year I had to create a game with a group. We got 3 requirements that we had to fullfill, it had to be an exploration game, made for 2 players, and based off of park 1943.</p>
      <p>Thus, we created Puzzle 1943, after some brainstorming. A multiplayer puzzle game made for browsers, where you have to explore 3 levels and find all the secrets.</p>
      <p>I created the player movement, character select and the camera, specifically.</p>
      <p>The camera I made is a custom camera that calculates the distance between the two players, and zooms out based on a equation.</p>
      <p>I was also the lead programmer and project leader, leading the brainstorming sessions and keeping track of everyone's work, as well as helping everyone out when needed.</p>
